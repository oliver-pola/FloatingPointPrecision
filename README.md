## Monologue

Hello, my name is Precision, Point Precision. Today we will be floating.

(1 km) 

Over 1km now. Ok, actually travelled over 1.41km already, but let's not be pedantic.

(10 km)

Leaving 10km mark behind. The speed is amazing. You should try that!

(60 km)

It starts to feel a bit shaky.

(120 km)

Left earth's atmosphere. I should have taken my helmet with me.

(300 km)

Did I time-travel? I feel like an 80ies pixel character now.

(1000 km)

That's not pixels, that's mosaic!

(4200 km)

I'm just a handful of polygons now. This does not feel good.

(8400 km)

Am I still here? Can you see me?

I wanted to check some geostationary satellites at 3.58e7 m. Will we make it there?

No chance getting to the moon at 3.84e8 m.

(17000 km)

Now I totally disappeared. Please help me!

Scotty, beam me back to earth!

Your name isn't Scotty? Could you please press B to beam me home, anyway?

(Back home)

Thank you! I feel and look normal again.

What? This is because my model vertices are stored in local coordinates?

Otherwise they would now remain totally scrambled?

Whatever your technical mumbo jumbo means, It's good to be back!

But one question, how could I fly to the moon and survive?

What? You say I must not move? The camera and me have to remain near origin?

And the moon must move to us? Yeah, come on, are you kidding me?

Ok then, you do program that in. And I'll wait right here for our next trip.
